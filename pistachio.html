<H3>Pistachio
The pistachio tree originated in western Asia, and archaeologists believe pistachios became a food as early as 7,000 B.C. 
They came to the United States in the mid-19th century and commercial production began in the 1970s.

California, Arizona, and New Mexico make up all of America’s commercial pistachio production. 
You can buy pistachios shelled or unshelled, roasted, or salted. They’re available in most grocery stores, and you can buy them in bulk from pistachio growers.

Among the possible health benefits of pistachios:

High levels of unsaturated fatty acids and potassium. Both have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory traits.

They can lower your chances for cardiovascular disease. 

Pistachios are bursting with the fiber, minerals, and unsaturated fat that can help keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in check.
