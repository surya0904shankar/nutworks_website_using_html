<H3>Hazelnuts are a tree nut native to the eastern half of North America. 
Hazelnut trees are relatively easy to grow and begin producing nuts within 4-6 years of being planted.

The nuts themselves are relatively small—about the size of a large marble—and round. 
Fresh hazelnuts are crunchy, but can be ground into a creamy paste. 
They have a rich flavor that is still notable in recipes with other bold flavors, including chocolate.

Improve Heart Health

Hazelnuts are a source of omega-3 fatty acids.
 Omega-3s have a number of heart-healthy benefits and have been shown to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. 

In addition to their omega-3 content, hazelnuts are also packed with antioxidants that protect the body from oxidative stress that can contribute to hypertension. 
They contain high amounts of phenolic compounds, which help your heart stay healthy by reducing cholesterol and inflammation.  
Reduce Cancer Risk

Oxidative stress may increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer. 
Manganese superoxide dismutase—one of the antioxidant enzymes found in hazelnuts—helps decrease oxidative stress and may help reduce your risk of developing cancer.

Hazelnuts also contain vitamin E, which helps protect cells against the types of cellular damage that can lead to cancer.
