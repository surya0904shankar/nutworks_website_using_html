Cashews are native to Central and South America, as well as several Caribbean Islands. In these places, they have been enjoyed for thousands of years. 
Europeans encountered the nut during the late 1500s. After that, they quickly spread to India and parts of Africa. 

Heart Disease Prevention
In addition to lowering rates of LDL cholesterol, cashews may help to prevent heart disease due to their high magnesium content. 
Proper magnesium intake may reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease, which often occurs when the heart does not receive enough blood.

Stroke Prevention
The magnesium in cashews may help to reduce the risk of stroke. 
This link is most notable for hemorrhagic strokes, which result from a weakened vessel that spills blood into brain tissue upon rupturing.

Diabetes Prevention or Management
Cashews are low in carbohydrates, especially as compared to other common snacks. 
This limits their impact on blood sugar, making them a great option for those with type 2 diabetes, as well as those looking to prevent the condition.
